                                <p>Jeremy Woodward will participate in the Arizona Ironman competition on Nov. 19 &ndash; a decade after doctors told him he would never compete at that level again. "This is going to be a really special day," said Woodward, who lives in Concord, New Hampshire. "Celebrating that I can do it &ndash; that I'm healthy enough to do it &ndash; and having my family there at the finish line will be an emotional moment."</p>
                                <p>The moment seemed unlikely on Aug. 4, 2007, when Woodward, who was 28 at the time, was in class four heart failure and nearly died. His heart failure developed after an aortic valve replaced in 2000 stopped working.</p>
                                <p>"They all thought I was crazy, but from that point on, it became my ultimate goal." The triathlon in November, which included a 2.4 mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and 26.2 mile run within a 17-hour time limit, will be Woodward's second.</p>

                                <p>Still, it didn't seem possible when Woodward arrived at Tufts Medical Center in Boston with 45 pounds of fluid weight. During the procedure to have his aorta repaired and another valve replaced with a mechanical heart valve, Woodward also had a clot on the left side of his heart that required additional repairs.</p>
                                <p>"When we were in the hospital for weeks leading up to Jeremy's surgery, my biggest fear was leaving the hospital alone," said his wife, Brook. "Being there for weeks takes your mind to places you don't want to think about. We hadn't even been married two years, so dreams of having a family and a home just seemed liked they weren't going to be in the cards for us."</p>
                                <p>But after six weeks in the hospital, Woodward returned home.</p>
